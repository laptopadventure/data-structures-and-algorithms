# Challenge: Stacks and Queues

[Assignment instructions](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/LAB)

## Challenge

For code challenge 10, I had to create the queue and stack class methods.

## Approach & Efficiency

I chose to implement an array held inside the class that is interacted with by the other methods. I could have chosen nodes, but I felt it was easier without the node structure since queues and stacks are very similar to arrays.

## TypeScript Instructions

- Verify your types are correct with `npm run check`
- Verify your implementation is correct with `npm run test`
  - When converting the value in a node to a string, use the `display` function in [`Collection.ts`](./src/Collection.ts).
- DO NOT edit [assignment.test.ts](./src/).
- Add your own tests to [LinkedList.test.ts](./src/LinkedList.test.ts).
- Tests must pass the github workflow for full credit.

### Common Types

- `boolean` is `true` or `false`.
- `number` is any JavaScript number - `5`, `-17`, `22.356`, `3/10`, `Number.MAX_VALUE`, etc.
- `string` is any JavaScript string - `'hello'`, `'goodbye'`, `\`I am ${age}\``
- `interface Person { name: string; age: number; }` is a JavaScript object with two properties, `name` and `age`. `name` must be a string, and `age` must be a number.
- `(name: string, age: number) => Person` is a function with two parameters, `name` (a string) and `age` (a number), which will return an object of type `Person`.
- `() => void` is a function with no arguments, and returns nothing.
  <!-- - `'hello'`' is the JavaScript string `'hello'` and no other string. -->
  <!-- - `'hello'|'goodbye'` is either the JavaScript string `'hello'` or the string `'goodbye'`, and no other strings. -->
